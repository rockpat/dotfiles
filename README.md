# These are my Dotfiles :-)
**An automated symlink script is included!** (Though for the time being it's Hardcoded to be located & run from $HOME/Github/dotfiles!)
It's installing the needed programs & dependencies in a linux distro-agnostic way, btw.

**Currently Supported Operating Systems:** (Linux) Debian, Arch, Fedora, OpenSUSE, Voidlinux & all there derivatives. (MacOS) with BREW installed. 

*Note: If you're running Gentoo or any other Linux Distobution with a differant package-manager & know the packages, feel free to contribute.*

This Repo will store my dotfiles, config files & some random scripts I use often like the Fastfetch Autocompile one :-)
But other than that, I don't have anything of value to add besides that automation & scripts are BASED.

## Installation

Just run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rockpat/dotfiles.git ~/Github/dotfiles
cd ~/Github/dotfiles
./setup.sh
```
